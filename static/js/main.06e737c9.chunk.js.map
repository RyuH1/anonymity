This is a case-by-case determination that depends on things such as the nature of the data, why it is collected and processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. Some personal data you can delete whenever you like, some data is deleted automatically, and some data we retain for longer periods of time. For example:\n\n- We will keep the account information you provide to us for as long as you remain an account holder.\n- We will keep a record of the fact that you have asked us not to send you direct marketing indefinitely, so that we can respect your request in future.\n- We will keep usage information and analytics data for a reasonable length of time that allows us to provide our services and to understand how people use the Forum.\n\nSometimes business and legal requirements oblige us to retain certain information, for specific purposes, for an extended period of time.

Changes to these Terms\n\n  1.  We may make changes to these terms from time to time (if, for example, there is a change in the law that means we need to change these Terms). We will give you at least thirty days' advance notice of such changes. If you do not wish to continue using the Forum following the changes, you can cancel your agreement to these Terms by cancelling your Account. Your continued use of the Forum following the prior notification of the amended terms will be understood as your acceptance of the new terms.\n\n## 9.  Other important information\n  1.

If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under these Terms, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you.\n  3.
